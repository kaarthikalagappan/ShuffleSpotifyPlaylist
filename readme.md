# Spotify Playlist Shuffler

## Why?

Google Home devices won't shuffle playlists when setting a media alarm.

Waking up to the same song every day will drive you nuts.

So here. Have a separate computer do the shuffling for you.

## Requirements

 - [A Spotify application in your developer account with a defined Redirect URI (it doesn't need to resolve)](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings)
    - [Add `http://localhost:8080` to the Redirect URI Whitelist under the app settings](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/)
 - Python 3.x
 - [Spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy)

## Usage

In your config.cfg, enter in the appropriate fields:

- Your app's Client ID
- Client Secret 


On its first run, you will be required to open a link generated by the script and paste the resulting URL back into the terminal. Don't worry if the result is unreachable, just paste it back in.

An authorization token will be placed in the script's folder. No further interaction is needed.
